# Utilities
A series of utility programs that I've made for random reasons. 

These are designed to be *small* programs. Instead of creating a repository for each program, I've decided to condense them into one repository.

## Current Utilities
- `lmgtfy`: A utility program that takes in a query and prints a **L**et **M**e **G**oogle **T**hat **F**or **Y**ou link *and* a Bit.ly link (to hide the LMGTFY link).
- `spongebob`: A utility program that takes in a query and prints out the SpOnGeBoB-fOrMaTtEd TeXt VeRsIoN. 

I'll make and add more utility programs to this repository when needed.

## License
All utility programs are released under the MIT license.
